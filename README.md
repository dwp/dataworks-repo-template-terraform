# dataworks-repo-template-terraform

## Description

This repo contains Makefile and base terraform folders and jinja2 files to fit the standard pattern.
This repo is a base to create new Terraform repos, renaming the template files and adding the githooks submodule, making the repo ready for use.

`make bootstrap`
