# dataworks-repo-template-terraform

## Description

Welcome to your new DataWorks GitHub repository.

This repo contains Makefile and base terraform folders and jinja2 files to fit the standard pattern.
This repo is a base to create new Terraform repos, renaming the template files and adding the githooks submodule, making the repo ready for use.

Running aviator will create the pipeline required on the AWS-Concourse instance, in order pass a mandatory CI ran status check.  this will likely require you to login to Concourse, if you haven't already.

After these steps are ran, you can manipulate and change them to suit your needs.
